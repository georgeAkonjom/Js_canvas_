# Briefing

A most likely incomplete 2d action platformer with multiplayer support (lol). Built with `javascript` and `HTML Canvas`. Noob stuff.

## To do

- ### Display the players

Player sprites... (Like draw them...? Nah...)
Create a player class so you can spawn any amount of players onscreen. ...done

- ### Move the players

Bind movement actions to keys ...done. Kinda still needs a ton of work...
Cause players to collide ...
slide stop so things are smooth .on hold

- ### 'Hit' the players

Hit animation
Attack animation
allow player weapons to overlap the enemy, but damage is dealt only when attack button is pressed
Deal damage

- ### Kill the players

Death animation
Remove the dead sprite from onscreen.

## Distractions

- ### Websockets

You know you want that two player experience. (Theres nothing to experience. Build the game first dumbass)

- ## Lore

What kind of game even is this?
